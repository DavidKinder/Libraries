# Libraries
Utility and library code used by my projects.

## mfc

Various C++ helper classes, mostly MFC related, used in multiple projects. Written by me unless noted otherwise in the source code.

## libmodplug

A library for playing MOD music files, originally from the ModPlug sound engine, written by Olivier Lapicque. This is version 0.8, taken from http://modplug-xmms.sourceforge.net/, with some minor fixes by me as needed. Later versions of this code are available from https://github.com/Konstanty/libmodplug/, but I have had both compilation and run-time problems with later versions, so am sticking with this version 0.8 for the present.
